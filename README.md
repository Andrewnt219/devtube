## My major discoveries

- Next.js

  It is easy to learn new things, but updating your knowledge is a different story. Next.js introduces lots of new concepts, and there were not many up to date tutorials out there. Learning Next.js was the first time that I learned a new stack purely through reading documents and searching forums. 

  Even then, I was struggling to wrap my head around redux state management with a server store. I kept questioning myself if it is worth going through all this trouble when I could stick with just React. But I had encountered these thoughts numerous times before, when I first learned React, or when I tried Redux. Eventually, I mastered the framework.
